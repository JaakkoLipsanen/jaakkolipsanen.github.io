			<p>My name is Jaakko Lipsanen. I am an 18-year-old game developer from Helsinki, Finland. Most of my completed projects can be found on this site.</p>
			<p>I have programmed and develoedg games for three years. During that time, I have released several games for Windows Phone with over 800,000 downloads.</p>
			<p>I consider myself to be proficient in C# and Java and moderate in C++. I also know the basics of Clojure, Python as well as HTML and CSS (this page proves that!).</p>
			<p>I have developed my games mainly using C# and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA">XNA</a>, but recently I have changed to using <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>. I have also made some projects using SFML and C++.</p>
			<p>I am graduating from high school in the spring of 2014 and I am planning to start studying Computer Science at the University of Helsinki in the fall of 2014.<p>
