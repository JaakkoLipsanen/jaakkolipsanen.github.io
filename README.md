My personal website. At the moment, it contains a blog and information about my cycling trips.  
This was one of my first web projects, the code is in a definite need of a refactoring :) !

All assets (blog posts, routes, images etc) are in my (now private!) [**assets**](https://github.com/JaakkoLipsanen/assets) repository.
