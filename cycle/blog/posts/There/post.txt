text: Yay, I finally got to Death Valley! The first place I visited was Dante's View. There was a pretty big climb up there and I was super tired biking it. It shouldn't have been as tough as it was and I think maybe I just hadn't been eating enough. Or maybe I was dehydrated, it was a hot day! I think dehydration causes loss of appetite too, which doesn't help! Anyways the Dante's View was really amazing sight. It was at around 1500m high and it had great view on the valley below! Definitely one of the top 3 sights I've ever seen. It was super strange looking at cars driving on a road over 1500 meters below, it almost felt fake :)

text: Next up was Badwater Basin, the lowest point in North America and one of the lowest places in the world at -85.5m below sea level. It was pretty interesting. The ground in there was almost fully just salt (I confirmed it by tasting it!) :) It was around 30km ride each way from the campground where I was staying. The ride to Badwater was really fast and easy thanks to the nice tailwind I had, but the ride back was super slow and exhausting..

text: After Badwater I had a much appreciated shower in the campground :) The next day I headed to Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes. I arrived there just a bit before the sunset. The dunes were very beautiful and it was super fun to walk (and run down the dunes!) barefooted :)
