text: Whee, I'm touring again! I'm starting in Las Vegas and I plan to first visit California, then head to Utah and Colorado. Then somehow get back to west coast where I'll likely be flying back from. So I have a long trip ahead!
text: I arrived to Las Vegas around 5pm and spent the first couple hours waiting to be questioned because the border control officer thought I was suspicious! I don't blame her, I admit I was pretty suspicious and aloof. Anyways, after getting through the initial hassle I wandered around the airport for a few hours and managed to get a solid 4 hour sleep before heading off in the morning.

text: Vegas itself was fairly boring. One big road with fancy casino hotels and outside of that lots of trash, huge empty properties, homeless people and boring suburbs. Even the main boulevard wasn't very exciting, though I admit I was there at around 8am :)
text: So I headed to the Red Rock Canyon State Park. It was really pretty, but I unfortunately didn't have time to explore it very much since I was in a bit of a hurry to get to my camping spot. I could've camped just where-ever like I usually do, but since there were some places where you are allowed to camp in I figured that might as well. The only place where you are allowed to camp in and is accessible with bike is a road called Rocky Gap, so I headed there. Bad mistake. Like the name says, it was very rocky road. Not even a road actually, it was  a 4x4/Jeep trail. So I spent the first evening and the second day just basically pushing my bike through that! Nice way to start a tour :P
