text: I camped near the top of Grand Mesa and in the morning I descended looong way down. I think it was something like +30km/-1400m of descent which was pretty fun!
text: After Grand Mesa it was the turn for a lot of back-to-back mountain passes. First up was Kebler Pass, elevation ~3000m if I remember correctly. On top of the Kebler Pass there was a gravestone of a girl who lived there and died at very young age sometime in the late 1800s. There was a pretty interesting poem in her gravestone that went "something something. As you are now, so once was I. As I am now, soon you must be. Prepare yourselves to follow me." I liked it. Kebler Pass descended into Crested Butte which was a pretty hipster small town between the towns.

text: Next up was the Cottonwood Pass. The road up there was unpaved but interestingly the road down was paved. The summit of the pass was around 3700m which is pretty damn high, but it didn't really seem any higher than the high passes in the Pyrenees almost two kilometers lower. It just barely went above the treeline in the last couple kilometers before the summit.

text: After Cottonwood there was a bit longer flat section before Boreas Pass. Boreas Pass was a really nice and quiet dirt road from ghost town of Como to Breckenridge. It's also a section of the Great Divide Mountain Bike Route, a route that goes from Banff, Alberta to the Mexican border in New Mexico. Breckenridge itself was a big ski town with tons of all kinds of shops everywhere. Lots of bikers during the summer too.

text: Aand onto the next pass, from Breckenridge to the east the only non-interstate road goes through the Loveland Pass. On the way up there were some skiing centers and the only one that was open was open for the last day before closing, so there were tons of people. It was pretty cold on the way up and it even rained a bit so I was really wet from the sweat and the rain when I reached the top. From the summit of Loveland Pass it was like +60km of downhill/flat to Idaho Springs which was pretty nuts. Most of it was on quiet bike paths and small roads too which was nice!
