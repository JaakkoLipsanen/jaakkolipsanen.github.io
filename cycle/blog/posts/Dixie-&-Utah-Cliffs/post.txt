text: My plan for the first few days in Utah was to follow Adventure Cycling Association's Utah Cliffs Loop -route, that forms a big loop in the southwest corner of the state, until Zion National Park. The route started in St. George, a big city I had no intention of going to, so I skipped the first 20 or so miles. The route entered the Dixie National Forest and ascended to around 2000 meters. The area reminded me a lot of Spain and especially Catalonia. Trees looked the same, same kind of not-quite-mountains-but-not-hills-either and sandy soil :)

text: Next the route took me through a reaally big hill. I think it rose from 1800m to over 3000 meters (hey, that's highest I've ever cycled!). In the top there was a road that lead to Cedar Breaks National Monument, apparently a really cool place, but the road was still snow covered and my bike was really not up to cycling in the snow :( The Utah Cliffs route next went through some small gravel roads, which were also snow covered.. I was also kind of disappointed to find that the road that descended off from the high altitudes and lead to Zion was also covered in snow and the first 15 kilometers before the descent were flat (and thus snow covered), so that road was out of the question. I really didn't want to cycle through the heavily trafficked paved roads any more than I had to, especially since the route by paved roads was almost twice longer. Fortunately I found an alternative dirt road that started in a bit lower elevation. It seemed like a very small road, but I figured that I'd be okay since the whole road was mostly downhill.

text: The road started quite nicely, but soon turned into a yet another Jeep trail. This time though, I don't think any Jeeps had driven there for a while since there were a lot of fallen trees and two locked and fenced gates :P The road  almost disappeared at some points (all the pics above are of the road) and it crossed a stream multiple times which at every crossing turned more and more into a river :)  I was also running low on water and food which made the possibility of the road disappearing a bit scary. Nevertheless, it was mostly a pretty okay road to bike since  there weren't any real uphill sections and I got through without problems.
text: After the Jeep trail road I was finally on the main road leading to the Zion National Park :) !
