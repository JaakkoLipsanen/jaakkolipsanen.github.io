text: After Idaho Springs and the Oh-My-God Road, I started following the Peak-to-Peak Scenic Byway. I'm not really sure what peaks the name refers to and the road wasn't super special or anything. Not a lot of cars though and there were some nice little towns on the way, like the Central City (wasn't Vancouver?), an old town and one of the only places in Colorado where casinos are legal so lots of casinos in really old buildings, and Nederland which was a nice little hipster town.

text: The Peak-to-Peak Byway ended in Estes Park, a big town and the entrance to the Rocky Mountain National Park. On the same day as I got there the Ride the Rockies, a huge multi-day cycling event with +2000 participants passed, passed through the town so there were lots of cyclists in there. I had thrown away my sneakers, that I used for hiking, after Canyonlands in Utah (which in hindsight might've been a mistake), so I decided not to do any hikes. And I'm pretty sure that the best way to explore the RMNP would be with longer, overnight hikes. So I just cycled through the park. There are only two roads leading through the mountains in the park from Estes Park. The main road was really busy, but there is a smaller, unpaved and one-way road called the Old Fall River Road that goes up from Estes Park to the top of the main road. And since it wasn't still officially opened, there were no cars on the road which was nice!

text: After getting to the top I hanged there for a bit. It was really really windy and I had a long descent down, so I layered up. After descending I started heading towards Wyoming. I cycled for a couple days on the same route as the official TransAmerica cycling route goes so I met lots of cyclists on the way.
