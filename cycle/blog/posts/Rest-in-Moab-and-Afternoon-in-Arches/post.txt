text: So I stayed in a hostel in Moab for three nights. I hadn't had a total rest day for almost a month and the hostel was pretty cheap so I figured why not. I also had a backcountry permit for Canyonlands that was starting in 5 days so I pretty much had to wait. I didn't do much on those rest days, I just went through and cleaned my gear, went to a cinema to watch the new X-Men (which was pretty good!). Otherwise I just chilled :)
text: So after staying in the hostel I bought food for like 4 days and started heading to the Island in the Sky district of the Canyonlands National Park. On the way there was the Arches National Park, so I cycled through most in a few hours. I didn't have time to do any hikes or see the most of the arches (most of them seemed to be in the northern part of the park), but I dont really feel like I missed much.
