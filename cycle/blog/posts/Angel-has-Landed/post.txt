text: The first hike I did in Zion is probably the best known one; Angel's Landing. The first three quarters of the hike is a pretty steep but wide trail, but the last mile or so is where it gets exciting. During the last stretch the route follows a very narrow ridge where the trail turns into rocky and very steep path :) It was quite fun hike and in the top you had an amazing 360 degree view of the Zion Valley, which is the main area in Zion National Park! There were also A TON of chipmunks at the top, who were trying to get food scraps from the hikers. One of the chipmunks even managed to steal half of my oatmeal energy bar while I wasn't looking :P !

text: After returning back from the Angel's Landing I wasn't very tired yet and had a few hours of sunlight left, so I decided to do one of the shorter hikes. Emerald Pools trail led through the forests on the valley floor to a couple of water pools where the water was falling to from the top of the huge cliffs defining the valley. It was very pretty and nice contrast from the Angel's Landing hike where the beautifulness came from the high panoramic viewpoint :)
