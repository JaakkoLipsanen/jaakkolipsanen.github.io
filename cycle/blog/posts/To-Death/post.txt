text: After struggling through the Rocky Gap, I found myself in a quiet National Forest. So I camped there, which extended my "legally camping" streak to two which is probably unprecedented!
text: The slow first days really messed with my expected schedule so I was forced to cycle by some pretty big roads to get more water. The shoulders were wide and drivers were courteous (despite being warned about them twice in just as many days!) so I didn't mind though.

text: I decided to enter Death Valley from south. There is a nice small paved road leading to the park passing the lowest point in Americas but it had been closed fot the past six months because of flood damage. So I headed to a small remote dirt road that entered the park. I was pretty disheartened to find out that my bike wasn't really up to it. It was very washboarded (full of bumps every ~25cm) and there was a lot of loose sand. So I had to turn back and make a pretty long detour... But I finally got to Death Valley :) !
