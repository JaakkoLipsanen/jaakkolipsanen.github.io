text: After Hoh, it was time to continue following the main road, Highway 101, that I would be following almost all the way to California and Los Angeles. The road went back to the coast for maybe 15km, before heading back inland. During those 15km there was several beaches, Beach 1 to 6 (so imaginative naming these people have..) and the Ruby Beach. I got to Ruby Beach around 11am and it was really foggy and beautiful!

text: So after leaving the coast, and the Olympic National Park, the road lead inland and got pretty boring for the rest of Washington. There were some detour options going back to the coast, but I was already a bit behind the schedule so I elected to stay on the highway.
