text: After leaving Vegas I headed to a smallish road going through Lake Mead National Recreation Area. Lots of hills and cliffs. The photos I took don't show it very well, but many of the cliffs were really red which looked cool! Apparently the redness is caused by the same reason as why Mars is red; there is a lot of iron on the ground which is oxidizing aka rusting!
text: There was a state park called Valley of Fire nearby and I was originally planning to head there. I saw it from far away and it looked really cool (huge dark red colored cliffs!), but in the end I decided not to go because of entrance fee, the fact that I'd have to cycle back the same way, I was a bit low on food and water and especially because I was super tired! I really don't get how some people can cycle 100 miles or even 100km day after day! Maybe if it's perfectly flat and you have a nice tailwind all the time :) I think my biggest problem is that I just don't eat enough. I somehow lose my appetite when cycling and end up eating less than when I'm at home and do nothing :/

text: So instead of going to Valley of Fire, I cycled to a town called Moapa Valley. Looking at the map I found a nice, remote dirt road going straight to the direction I was heading. An alternative paved road would've taken a long detour and been right next to a big interstate highway, so it was an easy choice. The road was pretty rugged, but nothing too bad. One thing that I've started to do on long, boring/slow/uphill stretches is that I've started to listen audiobooks. It really takes your mind off things and makes the time go faster! The road was quite rugged but pretty and there were a few of these "rims" where a tall cliff separated two plateaus from each other.

text: Next I cycled across the state line first to Arizona for one night and then finally to Utah. The area where I entered to Utah was some sort of National... Landmark(?)  and there was a nice, quiet looking "scenic backway" which went around the area. So I made a littke detour and cycled through it.
text: After the scenic road I was near to an early section of the Utah Cliffs Loop, a route I was going to follow next.
