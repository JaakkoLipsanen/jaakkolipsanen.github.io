text: The road leading out of Death Valley was a again a big ascent. I feel like the hills/mountain passes here in USA can be deceiving. They seem like "oh, that's just a small uphill, no biggie" but while they might not be steep, they are often very long. The road ascended over 1300 meters from zero altitude. Thats more than most of the mountain passes I did in the Alps or Pyrenees on my last tour. +30C temperatures made it definitely a hard climb!

text: After leaving Death Valley I ended up on a pretty big highway which led to Vegas. It was getting pretty late when I saw a sign that said "Big Dune" and an arrow pointing to the right. And there indeed was a big dune in the distance! I got a bit excited and decided to cycle as close as I could and then walk rest of the way there. It was already dark when I started walking and I think it took me about an hour to walk there, but damn it was really cool! I didn't get any good pictures, but the largest dunes were at least 50 meters tall, probably closer to 100! It was pretty dark so I decided to go to one of the smaller dunes, but even that was probably 25 meters tall! I read there The Martian for a bit (great atmosphere!) and then headed back :)

text: The next day I cycled through Ash Meadows Wildlife Refuge. Very interesting place! It was in the middle of normal Nevada scenery, that is sandy ground with small bushes, but it was lushing with life. Birds were singing, frogs were... frogging and canines were running around. And it was full of grass and trees. I don't really know why it was so different than it's surroundings. There wasn't a big river going through or anything. But it was really pretty and a nice change from all the desert.

text: After Ash Meadows I headed to a small dirt road leading through Spring Mountains via Wheeler Pass. Again, pretty interesting: the climb was, in terms of meters ascended, bigger than any of the mountain passes I cycled on my last tour in the Alps. Not as steep, but longer. The road up was pretty good most of the time, didn't have a lot of problems cycling it!

text: The road down from the Wheeler Pass was on the other hand reaally bad. It was more of a Jeep trail than a road mostly. It was okay to bike down since I could just let gravity do its work, but I was REALLY glad I wasn't going up! The scenery was super pretty though, I could see probably over 75km away from the road! I camped midway down and during rest of the descent next day there were some wild horses just hanging near the road :)
text: Then, I entered Vegas.
