text: I arrived to Vegas pretty late. I first went to an outdoor store to buy some stuff and by the time I was out, it was already dark. I found a nice quiet street that lead right next to my hostel and had a nice bicycle lane. It was really fun to blaze through the city in the dark! By the time I arrived to the hostel, I had already cycled over 90km and it was 11pm. One would think that I would just head to shower and sleep, but nope! For some reason, that in hindsight wasn't the wisest decision, I decided to not get a bed for the first night! I left my bike and my bags to the hostel and headed to to the Strip (aka where the casinos are).
text: So I went through basically every casino during that first night. I later found out that 0am-6am isn't really the best time to visit the casinos and that there were some pretty interesting stuff earlier in the evening (like live flamingos in the Flamingo!). The casino floors were exactly same in every place. 95% of the floor is covered in slot machines, 4% in blackjack/roulette/"fast poker" tables and 1% in actual poker tables (you know, the only actually interesting stuff!). Anyways, I got really tired around 6am and I found a really nice massage chair in the Ceasar Ceasar where I napped for a while until the security kicked me out :P The nap did wonders since I had lots of energy after I headed back to hostel and did laundry, fixed and cleaned all my stuff and showered (ahhh...).
text: On the last night I headed to Fremont Street ("Old Vegas") with an Argentinian guy from my dorm room. It was a lot more interesting than the Strip. It was full of street performers, live musicians etc. There was also a huge screen covering the entire sky so you it was really bright even in the night :)
text: The next morning I chilled at the hostel until I got enough energy to get up and start biking east towards Lake Mead.
