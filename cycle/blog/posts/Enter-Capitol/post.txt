text: After the snowstorm on the previous afternoon I cycled for a few kilometers from the town of Boulder and camped. Next morning by the time I got moving again a lot of the snow had already melted and even on top of the mountain pass, at around 2900m, there wasn't any significant amount of snow. On my way down from the mountains I had two route choices. Either continue the main road all the way down, or head to smaller forest roads that lead to the Capitol Reef National Parks "Scenic Drive" road. I decided to head in to the smaller roads, because they are usually a lot more interesting!

text: The forest road started as a very good quality gravel road, but soon turned into sandy and rocky jeep trail. I later found out that the Capitol Reefs official map describes the road as "an extremely rough unmaintained 4 wheel-drive road" :P But the road was actually really fun to cycle on and it was very beautiful!

text: The small road ended right at the end of the Capitol Reefs Scenic Drive road. From the end of the Scenic Drive, another dirt road began which led to a narrow canyon. It was really pretty, especially since the sun was starting to get down :) There were a couple of hikes starting at the end of the road, but it was getting late so I couldn't hike them..

text: It was getting pretty late and I had no idea where I would camp, so I hurried to the main area of the park. Like I expected, the campground was full. I didn't have time to get out of the park so I ended up camping fifty meters or so from the main road passing through the park. You're not allowed to camp within the national parks except in the campgrounds and I try to respect that, because the parks here in the USA really are pretty special, but I didn't really have an option..
