text: So, I kinda wanted to go to the Monument Valley, but it's located in the Utah-Arizona border which was basically in the opposite direction of where I was going. So what I did was that I left all my bags and tent hidden behind a rock in the place where I camped and cycled to Monument Valley and back with just some food and water. The Monument Valley is in the Navajo Nation, a huge native American reservation in SE Utah, NE Arizona, SW Colorado and NW New Mexico. Apparently a lot of the Navajo people live in poverty and it was pretty visible. I saw dozens of tables/stands right next to the highway where everyone was selling "Navajo made jewelry". I think I probably saw less than 5 customers in all of those stands combined :P
text: In Monument Valley the only road that actually goes into the park and between the rocks is a pretty rough dirt road. It kinda suprised me because I don't think it would be that expensive to pave it. On the other hand, they offer tours on the road on kind of a Jeep-buses that they had and they probably make a lot of money from that too..
