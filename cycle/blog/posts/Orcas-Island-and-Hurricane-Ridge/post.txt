text: So after reaching Anacortes, the western endpoint of the Northern Tier right on the Washington Coast, I decided to go to the San Juan Islands, which is a group of islands just off the shore inside the Strait of Juan de Fuca. There is a ferry that goes to four of the main islands and I decided to first head to the Orcas Island, mostly because I knew that there is a big mountain and didn't really know anything about the other islands.
text: I was planning to take an afternoon ferry to Orcas, then bike to the top of the mountain and watch sunset and camp there. But nope, I didn't check the schedule and missed the afternoon ferry (even though I was camping like 14km away..) so I took the eveninh ferry. I biked for maybe about 20km in the dark and camped a bit before the road started to climb up the mountain. In the morning I left most of my bags to where I camped and started heading up the (really steep) road to the summit.

text: So after making my way up the mountain and visiting a nearby Obstruction Pass State Park, I started to make my way back to the other end of the island where the ferry leaves. I was planning to go to the San Juan Island and camp near a lighthouse, but once again NOPE! The last ferry of the say to San Juan Island had left like 10 minutes before I arrived. There were some ferries going to the other islands, but they were going to leave after sunset. So I decided to take a ferry back to Anacortes and continue south.

text: Next I took a ferry to the Olympic Peninsula and started making my way to the Hurricane Ridge road in Olympic National Park. There is a nice bike/walking path going through the northern peninsula called Olympic Discovery Trail so I followed that for most of the way.

text: The Hurricane Ridge road is a ~27km long road that goes from Port Angeles at sea level to deep in to the Olympic National Park, rising about 1650m/5000ft. I decided to camp around third of the way up in a campground at Heart O' Hills.

text: I felt that the mountains in the Olympic National Park were a bit underwhelming. Not as spiky and gigantic as in say, Glacier National Park. Speaking of glaciers, I'm pretty sure that there are more glaciers in the Olympic NP than in Glacier NP which is kinda interesting :P
