text: After Zion I decided to visit the Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park. I was a bit disappointed to find out that the sand wasn't actually pink. That would've been cool :P Anyways, the park was really pretty and I wandered there for a couple of hours on the dunes :)

text: Next I headed towards the town of Kanab. There is this super surreal place on the Utah-Arizona border called the Wave. Unfortunately, the access to there is restricted and you must obtain a permit to visit it. Every morning at 8.30am there is a lottery in Kanab in which the 10 people who get the permit for the next day are selected. So I went to the lottery in the morning and there were probably over 100 people in there! Blahh.. Didn't get a permit :(
text: So instead I went on to my next destination, Bryce Canyon National Park. I had a few different route options and decided to go with the one that went all the way to Bryce on small forest roads :)
