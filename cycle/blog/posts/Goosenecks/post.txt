text: The next morning I crossed the Lake Powell from Bullfrog to Halls Crossing. Even though Lake Powell is called a lake, it's just a part of Colorado River so you can't really go around it. From Halls Crossing it was around 150km to the next town, the Mexican Hat. The area around Halls Crossing was super dry and deserty and I was bit afraid that it would be like that the whole way. I was even offered a ride half way through and was pretty close to accepting it, but you know... you can't just skip the "boring" parts! And I'm pretty glad I didn't because the road was pretty fun actually and there were no cars so I just cycled in the middle of the road :)

text: I was planning to go to the Natural Bridge National Monument which was located around 90km from the Halls Crossing. I met Anthony, a guy who had been cycling from SF, eating near the entrance to the side road leading to the monument. He had concluded that the 30km side trip wasn't worth it and I kinda agreed. So instead we talked for a pretty long time. Turns out, he was a programmer and founded a start-up in Australia, sold it to Walmart and know makes god knows how much money in San Francisco. And with that money he had bought himself a 7,500$ titanium bike :P

text: On the way to the Mexican Hat there was also the Goosenecks State Park, which had an amazing view on the Colorado River!
