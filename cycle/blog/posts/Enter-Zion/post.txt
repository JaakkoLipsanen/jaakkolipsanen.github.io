text: I entered Zion National Park from the east, and as I later found out, the eastern part of the park is totally different than the rest. The scenery before the park entrance was relatively boring; farmland, some forest etc, but right away when the park area began it was all replaced with these really cool cliffs and hills!

text: The eastern and the main, southern part of the park was separated with a long, 1 mile tunnel. Bicycles weren't allowed in the tunnel and cyclists were required to obtain a ride through it, so I hitchhiked for the first time in any of my tours. It wasn't very hard, the first pickup truck stopped and gave me a ride :) But before that I did a small hike, I think it was called "Canyon Overlook Trail", which led to this amazing viewpoint of the Zion Valley. It was super pretty and it almost seemed fake. The cliffs were so high and so distant that it really seemed like something that shouldn't naturally exist!

text: After I got through the tunnel, I thanked the couple that gave me the ride and continued biking. It was a nice descent to the campgrounds, where I stayed for three nights. It was really funny how there were deers just chilling right in the middle of the campground. I had seen probably over 100 deers over the previous week, especially in the Dixie National Forest, but they always ran away the moment they saw me. But these deers were too lazy to care about me :)
