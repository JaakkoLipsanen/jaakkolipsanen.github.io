- Games Section
   - Thumbnail images to screenshots!!!
   - Support for mp4's in the "screenshots"
   - Previous/Next arrows to the popup images
   - Maybe disable scrolling when screenshot is "popped up"

- Gallery
  - Possibility to preview all images (thumbnails) in one big and large grid
  - Map? Map which shows the images on the map?
  - There are some visual glitches sometimes..

  - Should the games-section's "screenshot gallery" use the same "back-end" as the cycle gallery?


- Cyclemap
  - Checkbox to turn on/off labels in the map
  - Fix the firefox performance. 
    IIRC it has something to do with GMaps firing too many events (you need to limit the event count)
